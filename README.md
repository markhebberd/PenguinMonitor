# PenguinMonitor

**PenguinMonitor** is a Visual Studio .NET Android application created to document Bluetooth connectivity with the **Gallagher HR5 EID Reader**. This code _might_ also support the **Gallagher HR4 EID Reader** but this is, as yet not tested.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Establish and maintain a Bluetooth connection with the Gallagher HR5.
- Collate resulting data in order to monitor chipped birds at a penguin colony in New Zealand.
- Provide a reference implementation for developers integrating Gallagher HR5 readers.

## Features
- Simple Bluetooth pairing and connection handling.
- Data exchange between Android and HR5.
- Lightweight codebase for learning and extension.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2022 (or later) with .NET Android workload installed.
- Android device with Bluetooth support.
- Gallagher HR5 EID Reader.

## Status
This project is intended as a **reference / documentation app** and is not production-ready.  
Feel free to fork, extend, and adapt for your own projects.
