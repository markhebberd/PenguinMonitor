TODO

- if expected eggs/chicks incorrect by more than 3 days +- uncertainty box should be red
- Penguin database query, clicking on a scan entry should 
	- show all known data about the bird 
	- prompt to enter optional information connected with the scan result, i.e. Sex, weight, etc.
	- Scanned entries should be bigger and easier to click
- penguin reporting under specific name to seperate britta from alternate locations (i.e. wellington?)
- Performance tweak: create multibox view card different from draw multibox view card.
- lock without saving -> discard wording. save/edit
- if a new breeding session was STARTED with a CHICK (unusual, as one would normally sight eggs first, but possible to imagine in a very low monitor environment), then the system would need to back-calculate likely egg laying dates, as the chicks had already hatched. This made me think of something that I will explain sometime about your automatic calculations/guesses. I think I can explain well when we get the next opportunity.

FIXED BY DESIGN


There is one other item, which is quite central, we already discussed - the concept of a Watch box, maybe a simple sticky tick box?
why not add button to FILES (if name changed) "Save to server"? 
server should clean redundant backups. 
move should adjust the box count of the source and destination boxes
Brittas GPS bug, accuracy
