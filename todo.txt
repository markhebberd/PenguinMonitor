returnee no longer chick, adult counter up one, chick counter not
no delete content of "box confidence" when subsequently enter regate (just like notes are not deleted when regate)

how to enter sex for bird, via database, all pengs?
app name = PenguinMonitor.apk
enter bird ID and get everything that is known about the bird, same for box, maybe that is later db stuff though?

FIXED BY DESIGN


There is one other item, which is quite central, we already discussed - the concept of a Watch box, maybe a simple sticky tick box?
why not add button to FILES (if name changed) "Save to server"? 
server should clean redundant backups. 
move should adjust the box count of the source and destination boxes
Brittas GPS bug, accuracy
